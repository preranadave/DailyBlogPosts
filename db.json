These moments don’t make you a “bad” person, they simply make you human.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Being labeled as “good” or “bad” often comes from how others view your long-standing patterns of behavior and personality. If you typically act with kindness, compassion, and fair judgment, for example, you may be perceived as “good.”</p><p><br></p><p>Being “good,” however, doesn’t mean someone can’t or won’t do bad things.

It largely depends on context.</p><p><br></p><p>More generally, though, here are some signs you may relate to:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>procrastination</li><li>avoiding responsibilities, even if it’s because you “forget”</li><li>breaking promises or not following through on commitments</li><li>lack of preparation</li><li>misalignment between your desires and actions</li><li>showing up late to important appointments or meetings</li><li>substance use</li><li>giving up when things get more difficult</li></ul><h2><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">3 reasons why you may be doing it</strong></h2><p>Self-sabotage isn’t a condition itself, but it may be a sign of several things. Here are a few causes of self-sabotaging behavior:</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Imposter syndrome</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>If you’re experiencing feelings of self-doubt, or beliefs that you’re not talented enough due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-imposter-syndrome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(61, 90, 153); background-color: transparent;\">imposter syndrome</a>, you may drop the ball rather than risk someone finding out that you’re a “fraud.” This, of course, isn’t the case, but you may feel like it is, despite your education, experience, and accomplishments.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>You’re on the fence</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Ambivalence refers to having mixed feelings about someone or something, unsure about which next step or decision to make. It can make you feel like you’re in a difficult situation, and all your options present challenges.</p><p><br></p><p>When you self-sabotage, you unconsciously move things in one direction or the other, so you’re no longer stuck with making that tough decision. This may decrease your feelings of emotional overwhelm or anxiety about decision-making.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Fear of success</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>“A person may self-sabotage out of fear of being successful,” says&nbsp;<a href=\"https://prudencounselingconcepts.com/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(61, 90, 153); background-color: transparent;\">Keischa Pruden</a>, a licensed therapist in Ahoskie, North Carolina.</p><p><br></p><p>“That may sound confusing, but being successful comes with much more responsibility and risk-taking. A person may be afraid of the added pressure of success,” she adds.</p><p><br></p><p>Typically, increased success brings about a number of changes, like the ones listed above, and more, such as, where you live, to the people you spend time with. This can come with a sense of loss or fear of the unknown.</p>",
